# HoldBlack-Unity

This is an experimental project which demonstrates a novel gameplay mechanic.

1. Use either the mouse or your finger to hold down in the black empty space.
2. "Enemies" will begin dropping from the top of the screen.
3. Do not let any "Enemy" touch your mouse pointer of finger.
4. If you stop holding down the entire game world and all objects will start to rewind exponentially until you put your finger down again.
5. Each "Enemy" evaded earns you one point.

This project contains in it examples of:
- How to implement an object pool.
- How to record the movements of 2D physics objects and play them back at variable speeds.
